-- Extra exercises: REVIEW

-- These exercises mix everything so far: 
-- SELECT, filtering and sorting, creating and changing tables, 
-- INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE, database design and JOINs. 
-- Before you start, check that 
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders; gives 15. If not, run webshop_reset.sql and press Ctrl+S.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders; -- Okey, Dokey! Here we go!

--	Level 1 --  Use webshop.db.

-- Exercise 1 : Show products in Clothing or Accessories that cost between 150 and 500 kr. 
--				Most expensive first.  (Expected: 4 rows)


SELECT product_id, name, category, price
FROM products
WHERE category IN ('Clothing', 'Accessories') -- OK
  AND price BETWEEN 150 AND 500
ORDER BY price DESC;



-- Exercise 2: Which orders were placed in February 2026 and are not cancelled? (Expected: 4 rows)

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_date LIKE '2026-02%'		--OK
  AND status != 'cancelled';



--Exercise 3: Show every order line with the order_id, product name, quantity and line total (quantity times unit price).
--			  Only show lines where the line total is more than 500 kr. Biggest first.   (Expected: 11 rows)

SELECT order_items.order_id, products.name AS product_name, order_items.quantity, (order_items.quantity * products.price) AS line_total
FROM order_items
JOIN products ON order_items.product_id = products.product_id
WHERE (order_items.quantity * products.price) > 500
ORDER BY line_total DESC;



-- Exercise 4: Which customers from Uppsala or Stockholm have placed at least one order? 
--				Each customer only once.   (Expected: 5 rows)

SELECT DISTINCT customers.customer_id, customers.first_name, customers.last_name, customers.city
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.city IN ('Uppsala', 'Stockholm');




--			-- Level 2 --
-- These exercises change data. Click Revert Changes after each one, so webshop.db is back to normal.


-- Exercise 5: A new customer, Leo Falk from Uppsala, places an order today: 1 Hoodie Black and 2 Socks 3-pack. 
--				Add the customer, the order and the order lines. Then show the receipt with product names using a JOIN.
--					(Expected: the receipt has 2 rows)

INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, city)
VALUES ('Leo', 'Falk', 'Uppsala');

SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM orders;


INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, status)
VALUES (last_insert_rowid(), date('now'), 'Pending');  -- ?  Weekend. NOW





-- Exercise 6: Order 12 is cancelled. Change its status, and put its products back in stock. 
--				Look at its order lines first to see which products and how many.
--					(Expected: Sneakers Classic goes from 12 to 13 in stock, Socks 3-pack from 100 to 101)



-- Exercise 7: Try to delete Hoodie Black (product 1). What happens, and why? 
--				How could the shop stop selling it without deleting it?  (Expected: an error)




-- Exercise 8: Add a column discount_percent to products. It should be 0 if nothing is given and can only be between 0 and 90. 
--				Give all Shoes 20 percent off. Then show every product with its price and its price after discount.
--				 Look up: ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN · 				(Expected: 12 rows)





--			-- Level 3 --
--	Exercises 9 to 12 use webshop.db. Exercise 13 is a small practice lab in a new database, cinema.db.


-- Exercise 9: Show every product with the dates it was ordered. Products that were never ordered must also be shown, with an empty date. 
--				Sort by product name.    	(Expected: 25 rows)



-- Exercise 10: Which customers have bought something from the Shoes category? Each customer only once.  (Expected: 3 rows)


-- Exercise 11: Show all pairs of customers who live in the same city, for example Anna and Johan. 
--				Each pair should only appear once.  Look up: self join (a table joined with itself) · (Expected: 5 pairs)



-- Exercise 12: The price of Hoodie Black goes up to 649 kr. Change it, then find all order lines where the customer paid a different price than today's price. 
--				Show order_id, product name, what they paid and today's price.       (Expected: 3 rows)


-- Exercise 13: Practice lab. A cinema shows movies in two salons. 
--				Each movie has a title, a length in minutes and an age limit (0, 7, 11 or 15). 
--				A screening is one movie shown in one salon on a date and at a time.
--				Customers buy tickets for screenings. 
--				Each ticket has a seat number and a price, and a seat can only be sold once per screening. 
--				Create cinema.db, draw the ER diagram and write CREATE TABLE with suitable constraints. 
--				Add test data: at least 3 movies, 4 screenings, 3 customers, 6 tickets, and one screening with no tickets. 
--				Then write three queries: all screenings with the movie title, sorted by date and time; 
--					every ticket with customer name, movie title and date; 
--					and the screenings that have no tickets sold.
--							(Expected: depends on your own test data)
